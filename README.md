# Phaser JS Snippets VSCode Extension

This is a VSCode extension to provide code snippets of phaserjs 2d game library written in JavaScript.

## Features

Main goal of this extension is to reduce the time of re-writing the boilerplate codes again and again for every small animation or games developer wants to build.

For example if you want a loader scene in your game, you just have to write pjsLoaderScene and the snippet will be there to complete your wishfull code.
